###Problem Statement
In some bank each month we are required to maintain some "Monthly Average Balance" and on failing of which bank charges some amount. Sometime we failed to maintain this for initial some days of the month. Now to maintain MAB, we need to add some extra amount so that overall average balance will become equal to MAB. 
So this script will solve two problem:

 *  How much average balance required to maintain to complete MAB
 *  If given some extra amount, for how many days you need to keep that extra amount in bank to maintain MAB
